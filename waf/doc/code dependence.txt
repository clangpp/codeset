Word Activation Force toolset code dependence

If you need to develop waf related programs that not depend on the executable file, the following content is just for you.
If you need to know the architecture of the tool's source code, the following content is just for you.

note: ":" means depend on

[main.cpp]: program command line entry and interface
    [waf_shell]: waf executer interface
    [logging]: process logging and error reporting
    [configure]: read command line option and configuration file
    [timing]: calculate and report time duration costs

[waf_shell]: waf executer interface, resolve command program options and call waf core algorithm
    [waf_core]: waf core algorithm, type definations
    [waf_facility]: waf program interface facility library

[waf_facility]: waf facility library, provide data structure and function (objects) to assist waf core library, help to provide a convenient program interface for waf algorithm
    [waf_core]: waf core algorithm type definations

[waf_core]: waf core library, implement waf related algorithm
    [cross_list]: waf matrix and affinity matrix data structure
    [sparse_matrix]: co-occurrence matrix data structure
    [serialization]: stream based/related waf algorithm

[cross_list]: cross list data structure, an implemention of sparse matrix
    [serialization]: cross list to/from stream

[sparse_matrix]: a simple indexed cross list to optimize random accessing of cross list
    [cross_list]: base data structure of [sparse_matrix]

[configure]: a simple configuration library, read configuration file and command line options
    [facility]: provide some simple tool for [configure]
